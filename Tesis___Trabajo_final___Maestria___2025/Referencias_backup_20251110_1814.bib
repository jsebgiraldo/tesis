  abstract = {Smart Grid is a way of providing bidirectional energy flow with the integration of latest communication technologies and advanced control methods to overcome the issues associated with the current power grid such as unidirectional power flow, resource wastage, reliability, security, enhanced quality, and increasing demand of energy. Integrating Internet of Things (IoTs) makes Smart Grid hyperaware and agile to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of electricity distribution. IoT‐enabled Smart Grids use IoT devices and sensors to collect real‐time data, allowing for automated monitoring, predictive maintenance, and better demand management. This study comprehensively reviews various wireless technologies for IoT‐enabled Smart Grids that could be integrated into home area networks (HANs), neighborhood area networks (NANs), and wide‐area networks (WANs). This work provides a comparison of wireless technologies for HANs, NANs, and WANs in terms of data rates, range, adaptability, internet protocol support, and various other parameters. IoT technologies, including ZigBee, Z‐wave, Bluetooth, Wi‐Fi, NFC, 6LoWPAN, wireless HART, and Thread, are suggested for operations in HANs according to the customer requirements with their operating characteristics. Similarly, for NANs and WANs, long‐term evolution (LTE), WiMax, and LPWAN are explored in terms of requirements of utilities. The study further analyzes the applications of IoT‐enabled Smart Grids and elaborates on the associated challenges and issues.},

  abstract = {The phrase "Internet of Things" (IoT) has been considered the next great prospect and a test for the Internet engineering community, technology users, society, and enterprises. The billions of physical devices are currently online, collecting and exchanging data globally. Anything as little as a pill or as large as an airliner can be made into a component of the IoT because of the development of affordable computer chips and the expansion of wireless networks. Devices that would otherwise be dumb are given a level of digital intelligence by connecting all these various components and attaching sensors to them, allowing them to communicate data in real time without human interaction. The difficulty of choosing the best wireless low-power area networks for IoT applications arises from the exponential expansion of wireless technologies connecting to the IoT. Therefore, this review investigates the importance of 6LoWPAN as a foundation for the IoT's future and reviews the history that led to IoT and the advantages of using 6LoWPAN-based IP networks. We also discuss the popular implementation and challenges of 6LoWPAN.},

Although there are some surveys available for MAC protocols of IEEE 802.11ah, they do not include a large number of schemes that have been recently proposed to solve different standardization and implementation-based issues. This article individually surveys issues and challenges in the different problem domains of the IEEE 802.11ah MAC protocol and analyzes the recently proposed solutions. Moreover, this article identifies various factors for further improvement of these protocols.

  abstract = {Networks deployed for Internet of Agricultural Things (IoAT) applications are often deployed in remote areas with limited coverage and a lack of standardization across sensing devices, posing challenges to reliable connectivity and resilient data exchange. The IEEE 802.11ah standard, commonly known as Wi-Fi HaLow, offers the potential for wide coverage and support for a large number of IoAT devices. However, such protocol still faces efficiency suboptimalities in channel utilization, particularly when handling heterogeneous IoT applications with diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose SoftFarmNet, a reconfigurable IEEE 802.11ah (Wi-Fi HaLow) network management architecture, specifically designed for remote monitoring and control of agricultural-based IoAT. SoftFarmNet leverages a network traffic prediction-based slot scheduling and station grouping scheme to enhance channel utilization and support different QoS requirements of IoAT applications. The proposed architecture integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) at the edge, enabling configuration of low-level Wi-Fi HaLow parameters and the management of multiple network slices to dynamically meet application requirements. Our performance evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements in throughput, delay, and energy consumption, effectively optimizing channel usage, with respect to state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract = {The implementation of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in telemedicine necessitates the deployment of various medical devices, including wearable and implantable sensors, in a network to collect diverse categories of medical data, resulting in the accumulation of large data volumes. The interoperability of these IoMT devices and networks determines to what extent the devices and networks can exchange and interpret medical data. The lack of standardised communication protocols for sharing medical data between individual devices and networks remains a serious challenge that needs to be addressed to unravel the potential of healthcare information sharing using IoMT. This article presents an exploration of practicable IoMT communication protocols to identify possible means of enabling cross-platform interoperability between devices and networks. Taxonomy of IoMT-based telemedicine communication protocols with use-case examples leveraging a large number of existing works of literature, have been examined. The use of open API, gateways and microservices for effective cross-platform medical data sharing is common due to the lack of standard communication protocols. Standardisation of IoMT communication protocols is possible by adopting the most effective open-source communication protocol such as the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) Protocol.},

The Objective Function (OF) lies at the heart of RPL, which guides parent selection and route optimization. However, conventional OFs are mostly limited to basic metrics, frequently overlook critical factors such as link heterogeneity, dynamic traffic patterns, energy fairness, reliability, and application-specific Quality of Service (QoS) demands. This survey presents a systematic and technically rigorous review of 108 influential studies published between 2015 and 2024, aimed at focusing on the multidimensional challenges of OF design across varied network environments and application scenarios. Rather than offering a broader overview like existing surveys, it critically assesses the adaptability of different OFs, the trade-offs they introduce, and evaluates their impact on routing performance, while identifying unresolved research gaps that limit scalability, interoperability, and practical deployment. It further highlights emerging solutions such as multi-metric optimization, context-aware routing, and machine learning–based OFs as more promising strategies to enhance the resilience and efficiency of RPL. By integrating fragmented knowledge into a cohesive framework, this survey not only strengthens theoretical understanding but also outlines a research agenda for developing next-generation OFs that are adaptive, crossdomain, and ready for practical implementation, thereby creating lasting impact for future IoT deployments.},

In this review, numerous applications such as advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), data distribution service (DDS), and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and how they can improve reliability and effectiveness in SG were discussed. However, there are still challenges faced when using IoT in a SG, such as the security threats and storage of large amounts of data as well as the exchange of information between equipment and control systems. Therefore, future research should focus on new security protocols that are specifically designed to address the unique challenges of IoT in SGs.},

  abstract = {Proxy servers are widely used in many contexts since they can enhance performance, security, and access control for production networks. The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), the de facto standard of Internet of Things (IoT) communications, specifies mechanisms and semantics to applications based on RESTful approach similar to HTTP. The CoAP standard defines an additional operation mode for proxying request, which is supported by several programming languages and platforms. However, there is no current implementation of a CoAP proxy for embedded systems, namely for devices supporting the Contiki-NG operating system. This paper discusses the design, implementation, and evaluation of a forward CoAP Proxy server for 6LoWPAN embedded systems with cache capabilities. We perform simulation and experimental evaluations with topologies involving up to three hops from the proxy to study performance in terms of response times and the number of exchanged packets. In simulation environments results show a 48.03\%, 85.39\%, and 134.21\% in response time reduction at one, two, and three hops away. In experimental environments, results show that the use of our embedded CoAP Proxy server reduces response times in 7.46\%, 30.67\%, and 37.43\% when requests are targeted to servers at one, two, and three hops away from the proxy respectively. In both scenarios, a reduction in the number of exchanged packets of 71.42\%, 125\%, and 166.66\% for requests at each hop is achieved.},

The traditional automation pyramid limits scalability due to tightly-coupled components. Integrating IIoT data in the cloud through event-driven communication, like MQTT brokers, provides loose coupling. This integration also aids in resource monitoring and planning, enhancing IIoT application performance. Despite many IIoT architecture studies, there is a lack of empirical comparisons of MQTT broker deployment strategies. This paper examines an edge-cloud aggregation scenario, where IIoT device requests are aggregated at the edge and fog services before being transmitted to the cloud. We study four MQTT deployment architectures and compare the results empirically. We use an Arduino Opta as an IIoT device. Also, we use software-based load generation to support replicability of our experiment and reproducibility of our results. Findings indicate that a central broker on a dedicated virtual machine gives 13.8\% improvements of the mean response time compared to the shared deployment of MQTT broker and device gateways. Our results offer insights into effective deployment strategies.},

  abstract = {Wi-Fi HaLow (IEEE 802.11ah) is an emerging wireless communication standard designed to address the growing demand for long-range, low-power connectivity in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Operating in the sub-1 GHz frequency band, it offers extended coverage, improved penetration through obstacles, and better energy efficiency compared to conventional Wi-Fi. Given its potential for deployment in diverse environments, particularly in developing regions with mixed urban-rural geographies, this study evaluates the real-world performance of Wi-Fi HaLow in Malaysia, a tropical outdoor setting. A testbed was developed using Raspberry Pi 4B devices integrated with AHPI7292S modules based on the Newracom NRC7292 chipset. Operating at 924 MHz, in compliance with Malaysia’s ISM band allocation, experiments were conducted across two geographical profiles within Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), a built-up road corridor and a relatively open river path. Key performance indicators such as Round Trip Time (RTT), Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and data rate were measured at varying distances and during different times of day (daytime and nighttime). The results demonstrate superior performance in open environments, such as riversides, with RSSI and data rate remaining relatively stable beyond 200 m. In contrast, signal quality deteriorated more rapidly along obstructed roadways. CloudRF simulations further confirmed these trends, applying diffraction-based propagation models with terrain and clutter data. The findings highlight Wi-Fi HaLow’s suitability for low-power IoT applications in semi-urban and rural tropical settings. While this study provides first insights into geographical and temporal performance factors, it acknowledges the need to integrate atmospheric parameters in future work.},

Theoretical performance analysis as well as system level design strategies are presented. Individual blocks of the receiver chain are specified as a condition for future circuit-level design. Simulation results validate the proposed system specifications attending the 802.11ah standard. The presented receiver provides 80.5dB maximum gain, 9 dB minimum noise figure and 69.4 dB of dynamic range. Those performance parameters lead to -99.4 dBm sensitivity, 21 dB and 51 dB for adjacent and non-adjacent maximum channel rejection.},

In this paper, we consider the IEEE 802.11ah multi-rate IoT network where stations (STAs) contend for channel access using group-based restricted access window (RAW) mechanism with the default uniform grouping scheme. RAW divides the channel time into various slots, STAs into different groups and assigns a dedicated RAW slot to each group of STAs. As uniform grouping scheme performs grouping on random basis, each group will comprise of distinct data rate STAs, which leads to severe degradation of throughput because of performance anomaly. We propose a novel RAW based resource allocation (RAW-RA) scheme which groups the STAs in a multi-rate IoT network based on data rates and allocates the RAW slots to the groups proportional to their data rates. We also develop an accurate analytical model with unsaturated traffic conditions for calculating the throughput and energy efficiency of the IEEE 802.11ah multi-rate IoT network with the RAW mechanism. From the analytical results, it is evident that the proposed RAW-RA scheme can resolve the performance anomaly as well as significantly improves the aggregate throughput and energy efficiency of the IoT network. Finally, all the analytical results are validated with extensive simulation studies.},

This technology brings revolutionary changes to WiFi, improving transmission reliability and power efficiency in scenarios with thousands of sensor stations being connected to a single access point. However neither novel channel access methods, nor advanced power management schemes can be used until the stations are connected to the access point, because the access point may not know that the stations exist, to say nothing about their capabilities. Nevertheless, it may happen that a large group of sensor stations are simultaneously trying to connect to the access point, which inevitably leads to continuous collisions and finally to extremely long connection process. This problem has been addressed by the technology developers which designed the Centralized Authentication Control protocol. The protocol provides the access point with an opportunity to hasten the process by managing the ratio of stations which are allowed to start establishing a connection. In this paper, we study how the number of successes depends on this ratio and develop two algorithms, which hasten connection process close to the theoretical limit.},

After a power outage or when a swarm of sensors appears in an Internet of Things network, all of them contend for the channel to set up links with the access point. For thousands of sensors the LSP can last for hours. However, it can be shortened with advanced LSP coordination algorithms. We show that the best standardcompatible solution found in the literature leaves a gap between the achievable link set-up time and the estimated lower bound.

To this aim, IEEE 802.11ah provides the restricted access window (RAW) mechanism, which reduces contention by enabling transmissions for small groups of stations. Optimal grouping of RAW stations requires an evaluation of many possible configurations. In this paper, we propose an analytical model (named e-model) that provides an evaluation of the RAW configuration performance, allowing a fast adaptation of RAW grouping policies, in accordance to varying channel conditions. We base the e-model in known saturation models, which we adapted to include the IEEE 802.11ah’s PHY and MAC layer modifications and to support different bitrates and packet sizes. As a proof of concept, we use the proposed model to compare the performance of different grouping strategies, showing that the e-model is a useful analysis tool in RAW-enabled scenarios.

However, the existing wireless technologies lack the ability to support a huge amount of data exchange from many battery driven devices spread over a wide area. In order to support the IoT paradigm, the IEEE 802.11 standard committee is in process of introducing a new standard, called IEEE 802.11ah. This is one of the most promising and appealing standards, which aims to bridge the gap between traditional mobile networks and the demands of the IoT. In this paper, we first discuss the main PHY and MAC layer amendments proposed for IEEE 802.11ah. Furthermore, we investigate the operability of IEEE 802.11ah as a backhaul link to connect devices over a long range. Additionally, we compare the aforementioned standard with previous notable IEEE 802.11 amendments (i.e. IEEE 802.11n and IEEE 802.11ac) in terms of throughput (with and without frame aggregation) by utilizing the most robust modulation schemes. The results show an improved performance of IEEE 802.11ah (in terms of power received at long range while experiencing different packet error rates) as compared to previous IEEE 802.11 standards.},

Toward this paradigm, a general framework inspired by the software defined networking (SDN) principle have been here proposed, in order to jointly optimize the application requirements by minimizing end-to-end delay and, thus, prolonging the lifetime of the IIoT ecosystem. This article derives a general SDN based architecture to handle data flows in order to support industrial applications that extend the basic publish-and-subscribe scheme. Specifically, the MQTT-SN standard have been considered, since it represents a solution suited for WoIT in the presence of resources constrained devices. The proposed integrated solution has been validated in practical scenarios, pointing out remarkable performance w.r.t. the end-to-end message delivery latency, always with a limited overhead.},

  abstract = {The evolution from traditional to smart grid systems has radically changed communication architectures. It enables secure, efficient, and resilient energy infrastructures. Unlike the centralized, unidirectional communication practices typical of traditional grids with minimal automation, modern smart grids use tiered, bidirectional networks allowing real-time control, integration of distributed energy resources (DER), and active consumer participation. The drive for this development arises from the growing use of renewable energy resources, electric vehicles, and sophisticated digital metering technologies. End-to-end communication architectures now underpin grid reliability, interoperability, and cybersecurity. This research explores the end-to-end architecture of traditional and smart grids, including access technologies, protocol layers (e.g., IEC 61850, Modbus, DNP3), and hierarchical network domains such as the Home Area Network (HAN), Neighbourhood Area Network (NAN), and Wide Area Network (WAN). Physical transmission mediums, key cybersecurity challenges, and standards like IEC 60870 are also discussed. Case studies of real implementations, emerging protocols, and security issues are analyzed to clarify directions toward intelligent, scalable, and self-healing grid communication infrastructures.},

  abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrate computing, networking, and physical processes, making them critical in applications such as smart homes, industrial control systems, autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and medical devices. Ensuring CPS security is essential, as vulnerabilities can have serious consequences. CPS share key security requirements with traditional IT systems—confidentiality, integrity, and availability—but also introduce additional challenges due to real-time constraints, interactions with physical processes, and safety considerations. Standard security practices include secure design principles, redundancy, continuous monitoring, resilient control algorithms, and rigorous verification and validation procedures. However, security techniques must be tailored to specific CPS domains. Some of the requirements may interact with each other, e.g., adding security mechanisms violating timely responses, or lack of security measures impacting safety. The complexity of securing CPS is further heightened by the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), which enables greater system autonomy in tasks like energy optimization and security monitoring. In this paper, we present results from two previous projects that focused on smart IoT systems and avionic systems, respectively. In both cases, arriving at solutions that combine many requirements is at the heart of the methodology. Based on this past work, we discuss open research directions.},

This combination has enabled the introduction of new services, such as demand response, automatic meter reading, and IoT-enabled Distribution Automation (IoT-DA), which incorporates sensors, actuators, intelligent electrical devices (IEDs), and information and communication technologies to monitor and control the grid. However, this integration also introduces network security risks, including Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, false data injection, and masquerading attacks, such as system node impersonation that can transmit incorrect readings, trigger false alarms, and lead to improper node control. To address these challenges, a secure hybrid gateway node was designed and implemented to safeguard communication networks. This solution uses Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to transmit historical data and mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) to send switching messages. The results demonstrate that the secured hybrid gateway node successfully ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and resilience against DoS attacks. In the future, this study will measure the efficiency of the implemented of the secured hybrid gateway node in terms of the security and performance in IoT devices by analyzing energy and memory usage.},

  abstract = {The increasing proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in modern smart grid infrastructures presents both transformative potential and unprecedented security challenges. As these devices play critical roles in energy distribution, real-time monitoring, and demand response, ensuring secure authentication and data integrity across decentralized and heterogeneous networks becomes imperative. Traditional centralized authentication models suffer from scalability issues, single points of failure, and limited resilience against sophisticated cyber-attacks. In this context, blockchain technology emerges as a compelling solution to establish trust, transparency, and tamper-resistance in smart grid communication systems. This study proposes a blockchain-based secure authentication framework specifically designed for decentralized IoT environments within smart grid networks. The framework integrates lightweight cryptographic techniques with a permissioned blockchain ledger to manage identity validation, access control, and trust propagation among interconnected devices. By leveraging smart contracts, the system enables autonomous device registration, mutual authentication, and secure session key establishment without dependence on centralized authorities. Furthermore, the model employs a hierarchical consensus protocol optimized for energy efficiency and latency, addressing the computational limitations of resource-constrained IoT nodes. Performance evaluations using simulation environments demonstrate enhanced resistance against replay attacks, Sybil attacks, and man-in-the-middle threats, while maintaining minimal overhead in authentication time and energy consumption. The proposed framework offers a scalable and resilient solution to secure large-scale IoT deployments in critical smart grid applications. By decentralizing trust and automating authentication processes, this blockchain-enabled architecture paves the way for next-generation, cyber-resilient energy systems.},

  abstract = {IEEE 802.11ah, marketed as Wi-Fi HaLow, is the new Wireless LAN (WLAN) standard for the Internet of Things (IoT) with many enhancements to the 802.11 standard. One of the new features, mentioned as the Restricted Access Window (RAW), focuses on enhancing scalability in extremely dense deployments. RAW divides stations into groups and reduces contention and collisions by permitting channel access to one group at a time. However, the standard does not mandate any optimum RAW grouping strategy. Existing station grouping schemes for enhanced throughput and Quality of Service (QoS) considered a fixed number of groups, though it is one of the important factors in determining the overall throughput. In this paper, we have proposed a real-time grouping scheme non-constrained on the number of groups for homogeneous periodic traffic with the same QoS. The proposed scheme uses Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering for station grouping where fairness and throughput are used as metrics for distance measure and level selection. Level throughput is estimated from its clusters(groups), using a Neural Network regressor with a 3-dimensional input vector. Evaluation of the network is done after every beacon interval and optimum station grouping and group parameters are broadcasted before the start of a next beacon interval. The proposed model was tested against uniform grouping and random grouping, an improvement of 20\%, and 50\% in the normalized throughput was observed. Fairness ratio of 0.945 was achieved with the proposed model.},

Indoor temperature, humidity levels, motion detection data, and water level readings collected by sensors can be stored in a database on the server for further analysis.

Implementing an IIoT system requires an IIoT Gateway to interface with industrial controllers using protocols like Modbus TCP/IP or OPC UA, enabling data transmission to the Cloud. These Gateways, often produced by PLC manufacturers, are typically expensive. This research investigates using an ESP32 microcontroller as a cost-effective alternative to the Simatic IOT2050 IIoT Gateway. The study focuses on connecting the Siemens Simatic S7-1200 12144C AC/DC/RLY PLC via Modbus TCP/IP and facilitating data transmission between cloud systems using MQTT and REST API protocols. Results show that the IIoT Gateway's response time for writing 16-bit payload data to the PLC via Modbus TCP/IP averages 0.0591 seconds. Additionally, the device supports data scaling from 16-bit Integer to 32-bit Float for Modbus TCP/IP communication and converting 32-bit Float data to Message data for transmission via MQTT to ThingSpeak Cloud and REST APIs to Blynk Cloud.

  abstract = {The fast advance and evolution of technology in Internet of Things (IoT) is a double-edged sword, striking with new performant solutions and backfiring with a lot of unanswered questions. Due to cheap manufacturing costs and large-scale production, sensors, actuators and even microcontrollers are not designed with security on the first place. Also, the IoT market is a new one and that means that it is still unregulated and there isn’t a well-defined set of standards to control and manage better these problems. The IoT ascent has impacted many industries, but probably the most changes were made to the Supply Chain Management (SCM) industry. The forementioned question of cheap devices that need to be manufactured with a minimum of costs, very fast and ready to be deployed, is digging a big security hole in this kind of ecosystems. This paper aims to discuss the challenges involved in hardening de security in embedded devices, protecting the data and the communication channels between an IoT node and an IoT gateway and finally, assuring the persistence of data and its security after is stored. All these matters are addressed with privacy and security in design. Because SCM is a multiparty ecosystem that involves many different actors each with its tasks and data handling components, it is important to assure the fact that they will not interfere, tamper, or profit in a bad manner of each other. One solution for this problem is decentralization that comes with strings attached. Finally, and on short, this paper will try to describe a security model based on decentralization in a SCM flow, addressing its threats and how they can be overcome.},

However, IoT collaborations face significant challenges due to security threats that undermine their reliability. An uncertified task publisher may deceive IoT devices into executing illegal tasks, while malicious attackers may intercept and modify transmitted data. Existing works on IoT trusted management issues tend to concentrate on individual aspects, such as authentication, privacy protection, and access control. However, trusted management for IoT collaboration is a multifaceted and intricate endeavor that necessitates a comprehensive approach. To fill this gap, we propose a lightweight authentication-driven trusted management framework that includes a novel authentication and key agreement scheme to guarantee the validity of task publishers, with greatly reduced overheads compared to recent works. The framework also incorporates a distributed data storage scheme and a fine-grained access control mechanism. We record the interactive messages on the blockchain to ensure behavior traceability. We evaluate the authentication scheme through comparative experiments and formal security analysis, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness. The experimental results of data storage and acquisition in real-world IoT environments indicate that the proposed framework is a feasible solution for reliable IoT collaboration.},

The proposed aerial devices can be involved and help significantly in dealing with natural disasters, by providing extended network capabilities in long distances. The major advantages of those developed emergency networks are indicatively the easy deployment, the low power consumption and the dynamic wide extension. In contrast with prior approaches which solely based on simulations, in this work the experiments are conducted with the use of real IEEE 802.11ah network adapters and drones.

  abstract = {In this article, the challenges of applying continuous deployment in IoT solutions are examined in the context of OTA firmware updates. The traditional continuous deployment approach used in software development is not directly suitable for IoT environments due to limited device resources, unstable connectivity, and the need for careful, staged rollouts. The article highlights that most OTA updates in IoT solutions are still managed with manual intervention by humans (experts), which slows down the process and introduces risks related to human mistakes. To address these issues and apply continuous deployment approach to OTA updates in IoT, the article proposes a solution based on adding to OTA deployment workflow the Data-Processing and Decision Making unit, which automates all the routine work, putting an expert aside to only decide on the most critical decisions and perform the most critical operations. This unit is responsible for making rollout decisions at every stage, based on initial commands received from an expert, and data received from previous rollout iterations OTA and Device Operability status reports. The proposed solution addresses challenges of applying continuous deployment to IoT, like deployment scale, latency in feedback loops, rollback complexity, and brings to the IoT domain the benefits of continuous deployment, like reduced costs, accelerated feedback loop, and improved quality. The proposed solution is device-agnostic, presented as a high-level architecture diagram, and therefore doesn’t contain details on protocols to be used and ways of implementation. The article also highlights directions for future research, including formalising the parameters used across the deployment workflow, defining the rules and thresholds for rollout decisions, and validating the solution through real-world testing or simulations. These steps are important to ensure the applicability of the approach across different IoT systems and to bring the concept from design to practical implementation.},

This standard endeavors to furnish a cost-effective operational mode capable of servicing numerous devices per cell across expansive coverage areas. This study delves into the IEEE 802.11ah Standard Network Planning for IoT Applications, focusing on enhancing network quality in terms of capacity and coverage to bolster WiFi network efficacy for supporting IoT services. Through simulations conducted for Smart Meters in the Grand Wisata Bekasi Cluster Area, it's discerned that LoRaWAN Coverage Planning necessitates only one site to encompass the Smart Meters, while Wi-Fi HaLow Coverage Planning demands between 7 to 211 sites contingent on the modulation utilized. Examination of various parameters reveals that LoRaWAN maintains a consistent Average Effective Signal Analysis value across spreading factors at -74 dBm, with a stable Average Coverage by Signal Analysis value at -67 dBm. Conversely, WiFi HaLow exhibits a spectrum of Average Effective Signal Analysis values for each modulation, ranging from -69 dBm to -34 dBm, alongside Average Coverage by Signal Analysis values spanning from -60 dBm to -34 dBm.},

The proposed DDC uses a polyphase mixer (PM) and a resampling filter. The PM adopts parallel coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) processors and lowpass filter arrays to reduce high-speed data rates with minimum resource utilization. Again, the resampling filter employs a cascaded integrator comb (CIC) filter associated with a parallel prefixed adder (PPA) and a multichannel systolic finite impulse response (FIR) filter implemented with canonical expression, attaining optimum hardware cost. Converting floating-point to fixed-point data types provides significant resource savings. Finally, the improved design is coded in the Xilinx Vivado synthesis tool and successfully tested on the FPGA Kintex-7 device. In contrast to other recent architectures, the proposed design substantially reduces area requirements and power utilization. The MATLAB tool verifies the design to achieve an acceptable spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 115 dB.},

This is partly due to a large number of remotely exploitable IoT vulnerabilities in service authentication and access control combined with the lack of timely technical support. To reduce the threat surface of remote vulnerability exploitation, we propose CMXsafe, a secure-bydesign application-agnostic proxy layer that can be updated and managed independently of the IoT device application. CMXsafe places IoT devices behind gateways operating as 4th OSI transport layer relayers to offload security concerns of IoT network communications into the proxy layer. Specifically, the proxy layer produces secure communication paths between IoT applications and platforms while enforcing mutual authentication and access control to proxied services. We evaluate the performance of our architecture on the MQTT protocol used in a standard publisher-broker-subscriber configuration provided by Eclipse Mosquitto. We compare the performance penalty on the protocol when securing communications with TLS following a monolithic implementation and with CMXsafe. The experimental results suggest that CMXsafe outperforms integrated security by providing at least a 25\% latency reduction and a 22\% bandwidth improvement.},

  abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) uses wireless sensor network (WSN) to monitor a civil construction’s conditions remotely and constantly for its sustainable usage. Security in WSN for SHM is essential to safeguard critical transportation infrastructure such as bridges. While WSN offers cost-effective solutions for Bridge SHM, its wireless nature expands attack surfaces, making security a significant concern. Despite progress in addressing security issues in WSN for Bridge SHM, challenges persist in device authentication due to the unique placement of sensor nodes and their resource constraints, particularly in energy conservation requirements to extend the system’s lifetime. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an innovative authentication scheme with deep learning at the physical layer. Our approach steers away from conventional device authentication methods: no challengeresponse protocol with heavy communication overhead and no cryptography carrying intensive computation. Instead, we use radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting to authenticate sensor nodes. Deep learning is chosen for its ability to discover patterns in large datasets without manual feature engineering. We model our scheme on IEEE 802.11ah, Wi-Fi HaLow of long-range communication and low-power consumption for machine-tomachine (M2M) applications. Simulations and experiments using software defined radio (SDR) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. By integrating security into Cyber-Physical System/the Internet-of-Things (CPS/IoT) design of WSN for Bridge SHM, our work contributes to critical infrastructure protection.},

This paper reviews the main aspects of LPWANs and their technologies based on an exhaustive search in several online scientific databases, such as Springer, IEEE Xplore, the ACM digital library, and Google Scholar. This research methodology enabled us to gather recent work on LPWANs, which forms the basis of this article. It is informative and knowledge-updating support in the LPWANs’ environment that broadly covers LPWANs. This research work has developed the characteristics of LPWANs and the techniques used to achieve long-range energy efficiency, high scalability, and low cost.

SoftwareDefined Networking (SDN) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these challenges by introducing flexible and centralized network management.

It enables various applications such as network management, quality of service (QoS) optimization, and system resilience enhancement. Pilot studies have investigated the possibilities of applying SDN on smart grid communications, while the specific benefits and risks that SDN may bring to the resilience of smart grids against accidental failures and malicious attacks remain largely unexplored. Without a systematic understanding of these issues and convincing validations of proposed solutions, the power industry will be unlikely to embrace SDN, since resilience is always a key consideration for critical infrastructures like power grids. In this position paper, we aim to provide an initial understanding of these issues, by investigating (1) how SDN can enhance the resilience of typical smart grids to malicious attacks, (2) additional risks introduced by SDN and how to manage them, and (3) how to validate and evaluate SDN-based resilience solutions. Our goal is also to trigger more profound discussions on applying SDN to smart grids and inspire innovative SDN-based solutions for enhancing smart grid resilience.},

Using an engineering design approach, an initial centralized agricultural IoT hardware test-bed was implemented with the aid of BLE, RPi 3 B +, DHT22, STEMMA soil moisture sensors, UM25 meters, and LoPy /low-power Wi-Fi modules, among other devices. This test-bed was adapted and modified after the proposed cluster-based architecture to evaluate the performance of CA-IoT networks. This study provides holistic account of our location-independent CA-IoT solution covering the design and deployment experiences that can serve as a reference document to the agricultural Internet of Things (Agri-IoT) community. Additionally, the proposed solution performed satisfactorily when tested under indoor and outdoor (on-farm) environmental conditions in the USA and Senegal. Unlike existing Agri-IoT test-beds, a sample performance evaluation showed that our contextrelevant CA-IoT technology is simple to deploy and manage by inexperienced users and is energy-efficient, location-independent, robust, and task- and size-scalable to provide a rich set of measurements for both educational and commercial purposes.},

Microservices Architecture (MSA) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing IoT systems security, yet its adoption in this context lacks comprehensive analysis. This systematic review addresses this research gap by examining the incorporation of MSA in IoT systems from 2010 to 2024. From an initial pool of 4388 studies, selected articles underwent thorough quality assessment with weighted critical appraisal questions and a defined inclusion threshold. This study represents the first comprehensive systematic review to investigate the potential of microservices in IoT, with a particular focus on security aspects. The review explores the merits of MSA, highlighting twelve benefits, eight key challenges, and eight security risks. Additionally, the eight best practices for implementing MSA in IoT systems are extracted. The findings underscore MSA’s utility in fortifying IoT security while also acknowledging complexities and potential vulnerabilities. Moreover, the study calls attention to the importance of incorporating complementary technologies including blockchain and machine learning to address identified gaps effectively. Finally, we propose a taxonomic classification for Microservice-based IoT security patterns, facilitating the categorization and organization of security measures in this context. Such a review can help researchers and practitioners identify existing gaps, highlight potential research directions, and provide guidelines for designing secure and efficient microservice-based IoT systems.},

One of the latest breakthroughs in wireless networking is WiFi HaLow, a WiFi standard with low speed and efficient power consumption. With wider coverage and high resistance to interference, WiFi HaLow can support the implementation of smart agricultural sensors and IoT (Internet of Things) devices on agricultural land. This can improve crop monitoring, optimize irrigation, and reduce overall resource use.The implementation of WiFi HaLow can also change the face of cities in Indonesia towards smart cities. With its ability to handle large data traffic and stable connections, WiFi HaLow can support smart infrastructure such as smart street lights, waste management and efficient traffic management. In this way, cities can become more efficient, sustainable and environmentally friendly.However, implementing WiFi HaLow in Indonesia also challenges several obstacles, including regulations, data security and infrastructure investment. Therefore, government, industry and other stakeholders need to work together to create an environment that supports the development of this technology.},

  abstract = {Wi-Fi sensing has recently gained popularity as it leverages channel state information (CSI) for various applications. Many researchers have studied different sensing applications, from activity recognition to Wi-Fi password cracking. However, there are limited studies on the potential use of Wi-Fi signals in collapsed structures, which could boost rescue operations. Wi-Fi signals at higher frequencies have poor interaction with rubble. However, Wi-Fi HaLow at 902MHz has shown promising results. To achieve reliable sensing, it is crucial to have improved coverage that can effectively measure CSI. Thus, in this study, we propose a state-of-the-art Hybrid Wi-Fi HaLow radar mechanism using Frequency Modulated Continous Wave (FMCW), Pulse-Dopplar (PDR), and Ultrawide Band (UWB) radars. We aim to achieve three objectives: earthquake debris assessment, FMCW, PDR, UWB radar techniques adaption at 902 MHz, and Hybrid Wi-Fi HaLow radar fusion. Our primary goal is achieved through meticulous site inspections of earthquake-related areas. Subsequently, we convert conventional FMCW, PDR, and UWB signals to Wi-Fi HaLow for optimal debris identification based on the characteristics of the structural engineering involved. Furthermore, we fuse individual signal components to form a comprehensive hybrid Wi-Fi HaLow radar. Based on simulation outcomes, the proposed methodology surpasses previous research and yields promising results.},

While the 6TiSCH protocol stack provides reliable low-power communication, the CoAP Management Interface (CORECONF) for runtime management remains underutilized. In this work, we implement CORECONF and introduce clustering as a practical use case. We implement a cluster formation mechanism aligned with the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) and adjust the TSCH channel-hopping sequence within the established clusters. Two use cases are presented. First, CORECONF is used to mitigate external Wi-Fi interference by forming a cluster with a modified channel set that excludes the affected frequencies. Second, CORECONF is employed to create a priority cluster of sensor nodes that require higher reliability and reduced latency, such as those monitoring critical infrastructure in industrial settings. Simulation results show significant improvements in latency, while practical experiments demonstrate a reduction in overall network charge consumption from approximately 50 mC per hour to 23 mC per hour, by adapting the channel set within the interference-affected cluster.},

  abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a wireless communication technology for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Although recent versions of BLE embrace the 6LoWPAN standard for IPv6 low-power device communication, this is often not the best choice for constrained-node networks due to downsides such as increased memory and computation overhead, heavier network stack, increased power consumption, backward incompatibility, etc. A crucial requirement for successful IoT solutions is an efficient strategy for monitoring and control of highly distributed sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a dynamic and lightweight model for management of distributed constrained BLE nodes based on OMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) protocol. To this end, we have designed a new intermediate component, a BLELWM2M gateway (GW), which has dual roles: a BLE master that monitors and controls the BLE devices, and a LWM2M client that acts on behalf of an operator’s LWM2M management server. The BLE-LWM2M GW has interfaces to dynamically manage connected BLE devices as LWM2M objects, called ObjectTwins, in runtime without a need for user configuration. All services that BLE devices provide are mapped to the ObjectTwins in the gateway, which are exposed to the LWM2M server. Hence, this model enables a LWM2M server to manage distributed BLE devices by interacting with the BLE-LWM2M GW using the LWM2M standard methods, and the constrained devices can still use a native Bluetooth communication protocol. To verify its feasibility, a prototype of a mobile healthcare system has been implemented in a testbed.},

  abstract = {Multi-agent IoT architecture for agroecological monitoring using semantic web protocols and Edge-AI codices provides real-time, predictive, and scalable environmental intelligence. The suggested method turns sensor data into useful insights via a multi-stage pipeline. Start with dependable data collection and editing. Normalization and dimensionality reduction handle noise, missing entries, and uneven sampling. Principal component analysis preserves the most useful traits. There are several ways to find abnormalities. We employ reconstruction-based error criteria and distance measurements to detect them. Ontology-driven mappings allow distributed IoT agents to integrate data into a knowledge base. We call this semantic interoperability. Edge-AI codices speed up local processing and semantic query execution, enabling faster decision-making. Recurrent structures that blend abnormality ratings and prediction embeddings capture temporal interdependence. These become probabilistic outputs that softmax-based layers can understand. A rigorous test reveals that the framework is better than other cutting-edge methods at accurately obtaining data, quickly normalizing it, maintaining features, discovering anomalies, and facilitating semantic interchange. The system now has higher scalability, computing efficiency, energy optimization, real-time processing, and sound decisions. This makes it better for dynamic farming with limited resources. Intelligent agroecological system monitoring is dependable, versatile, and long-lasting with the integrated framework. It aids environmental management and ecological prediction in complex ecosystems.},

Accurate inference of object properties is a crucial step toward enhancing grasping quality. Dynamic and Active Vision Sensors (DAVIS), increasingly utilized for robotic grasping, offer superior energy efficiency, lower latency, and higher temporal resolution than traditional cameras. However, the data they generate can be complex and noisy, necessitating substantial preprocessing. In response to these challenges, we introduce GraspHD, an innovative endto-end algorithm that leverages brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to learn about the size and hardness of objects and estimate the grasping force. This novel approach circumvents the need for resource-intensive pre-processing steps, capitalizing on the simplicity and inherent parallelism of HDC operations. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that GraspHD surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of overall classification accuracy. We have also implemented GraspHD on an FPGA to evaluate system efficiency. The results demonstrate that GraspHD operates at a speed 10x faster and offers an energy efficiency 26x higher than existing learning algorithms while maintaining robust performance in noisy environments. These findings underscore the significant potential of GraspHD as a more efficient and effective solution for real-time robotic grasping applications.},

AP uses the information about (i) STA’s uplinked data, which is in the claiming frames of those STAs that have successfully claimed, and (ii) STA’s downlinked data, which AP receives from Internet, to know the load condition of each data slot and then adjusts slots’ lengths accordingly. For the issue of channel access’s scheduling, the proposed method divides each data slot into two parts: (1) scheduled sub-slot, where AP schedules STAs that have successfully claimed their uplinked data and/or have downlinked data based on the time stamps of received claiming frames and downlinked data, and (2) remaining sub-slot, where STAs having uplinked data but unsuccessfully claimed can use the CSMA/CA control scheme to compete for the channel access privilege. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves overall network performance, including higher throughput, higher channel utilization and lower collision rate.},

  abstract = {In Wireless Sensor Network (i.e. WSN) based resource constrained Internet of Things (i.e. IoT) environments, efficient data forwarding is achieved through cluster based mechanisms, where cluster heads facilitate communication among themselves and with the sink node. Data collected by each cluster head is temporarily buffered before being transmitted to the sink via multi-hop communication. The integration of advanced wireless technologies, such as 5th Generation (i.e. 5G) networks, offers significant benefits, including reduced latency, extensive coverage, improved spectral efficiency, and higher data transmission rates. Incorporating Device-to-Device (i.e. D2D) communication further enhances energy efficiency and offloads data traffic, addressing critical IoT requirements such as low latency, increased network capacity, and improved spectral and energy efficiency. Software Defined Networking (i.e. SDN) addresses diverse IoT network needs across domains like smart grids, healthcare, traffic signaling, agriculture, and smart homes by enabling efficient communication, network management, and innovative control procedures. However, SDN’s application for anomaly detection and primary defense against security threats in IoT systems remains underexplored. This research investigates the potential of the design of an intelligent mechanism for energy efficient, privacy preserving, and secure communication in WSN based resource constrained IoT systems. The proposed approach leverages advanced technologies such as SDN, Machine Learning (i.e. ML), Deep Learning (i.e. DL), D2D communication, Computer Vision, and Network Function Virtualization (i.e. NFV). Additionally, it emphasizes assessing and offloading specific IoT application functions onto the network’s edge to enhance performance. Moreover, the development of lightweight security mechanisms for secure communication in resource constrained IoT environments is also identified as a crucial research domain.},

  abstract = {This paper proposed and implemented an energy-aware routing multi-level and mapping problem (EARMLP) algorithm to minimize the overall power consumption in Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based core networks. To enforce network utilization toward green policies design for Data Centers (DCs), SDN leverages protocol configurations for routing available in the infrastructure. Therefore, the proposed mechanism aimed to design an optimal routing strategy that considers system configuration and traffic demand between the data and control planes in networks. The problem is then addressed from the perspective of the policy-based EARMLP technique, which is used to carefully determine the optimal assignment between controllers and their switches to optimize network energy savings. Hence, a controller placement problem (CPP) is established to select the optimal locations and number of controllers in core networks and create an optimal mapping and resource allocation between switches and controllers. Since the formulated energy-aware routing algorithm is designed as a multi-objective NP-hardness of the problem, a heuristic approach is developed to find optimal solutions for traffic routing between inter-controllers and controller-switch in terms of energy-aware consumption strategies. Consequently, the proposed optimal routing mechanism can rearrange traffic to meet provisioning criteria by utilizing the capacity-aware design. Remarkably, the energy saved in networks by our suggested method can approach up to 70\% of the energy saved in SDN-based networks compared to other methods.},

  abstract = {The Edge computing has proved to be vital for implementing intelligent systems in real-time usage, especially where data privacy, latency, and bandwidth are an issue. Compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are designed and tested to suit deployment on ARM-based edge devices in this paper. To implement with efficient low-power consumption and minimal computational capability, these models are maximally suited for IoT ecosystems. Our system is optimized to stream preprocessed sensor data from the edge to the cloud only upon detection of anomalies, thus reducing data transmission and cloud dependency. We combine lightweight CNN architectures with anomaly detection mechanisms at the edge layer, utilizing sensor data from diverse industrial and healthcare sources. The framework ensures real-time monitoring with adaptive thresholds and dynamic inference techniques. Large-scale experimentation on synthetic and public datasets confirms the system's accuracy, responsiveness, and efficiency of use. The networks are evaluated using metrics such as inference latency, power consumption, and detection accuracy. The outcomes report up to 70\% bandwidth savings and 40\% reduction in cloud-processing overhead relative to conventional full-stream systems. In addition, a real-time ehealthcare case study illustrates the application of the solution in practice in patient monitoring settings. The ARM-powered edge processors accurately detect abnormalities like abnormal heart rates or fever peaks, triggering alerts to the cloud and medical staff without constant data streaming. The modular and scalable architecture facilitates deployment in multiple domains ranging from smart industry to personalized medicine with quick response times and better data security. The architecture also facilitates simple retraining and redeployment with low engineering overhead, which makes it ideal for large-scale edge AI rollouts.},

  abstract = {IEEE 802.11ah, commonly known as Wi-Fi HaLow, is an emerging standard tailored for low-power, long-range Internet of Things (IoT) applications. While the adoption of the IEEE 802.11ah standard has enhanced IoT network performance, several challenges remain, such as the hidden node problem, channel contention and collisions, and high energy consumption caused by idle listening. These issues primarily arise from inefficient station grouping schemes and inadequate scheduling of the Target Wake Time (TWT). This work addresses these challenges by proposing an integrated approach that optimizes the performance and energy efficiency of IEEE 802.11ah networks. The proposed solution combines Target Wake Time (TWT), which schedules wake-up times for IoT devices to minimize idle listening, with Restricted Access Window (RAW), which coordinates transmission opportunities to reduce channel contention and collisions. The integration of the TWT and RAW mechanisms aims to optimize key network performance metrics such as throughput, delay, channel utilization, and energy efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, simulations were conducted using OMNeT++ 6.0, comparing the integrated TWT + RAW approach against a traditional RAW slot allocation mechanism based on a transitive grouping scheme. Results from the simulations revealed that the TWT + RAW approach significantly enhances network performance, achieving a 14.75\% increase in network throughput, a substantial 20.5\% reduction in network delay, and a 3\% improvement in channel utilization. Additionally, the integrated approach demonstrated improved energy efficiency, attributed to reduced idle listening and more efficient energy usage.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) nodes consist of sensors that collect environmental data and then perform data exchange with surrounding nodes and gateways. Cybersecurity attacks pose a threat to the data security that is being transmitted in any IoT network. Cryptographic primitives are widely adopted to address these threats; however, the substantial computation demands limit their applicability in the IoT ecosystem. In addition, each IoT node varies with respect to the area and throughput (TP) requirements, thus demanding flexible implementation for encryption/decryption processes. To solve these issues, this work implements the NIST lightweight cryptography standard, Ascon, on a SAED 32 nm process design kit (PDK) library by employing loop folded, loop unrolled and fully unrolled architectures. The fully unrolled architecture can achieve the highest TP but at the cost of higher area utilisation. Unrolling by a lower factor results in lower area implementations, enabling the exploration of design space to tackle the trade-off between area and TP performance of the design. The implementation results show that, for loop folded architecture, Ascon-128 and Ascon-128a require 36.7k µm2 and 38.5k µm2 chip area, respectively compared to 277.1k µm2 and 306.6k µm2 required by their fully unrolled implementations. The proposed implementation strategies can adjust the number of rounds to accommodate the varied requirements of IoT ecosystems. An implementation with an open-source 45 nm PDK library is also undertaken for enhanced generalization and reproducibility of the results.},

  abstract = {A smart grid (SG), also referred to as an electric grid, represents an exceptionally reliable, efficient, and secure system for transmitting both electricity and data. Researchers and the power industry are becoming increasingly interested in SG because of its varied responsibilities. To achieve secure communication in SG environment, there is a need to establish a key exchange between participants. In an SG environment, a number of key exchange techniques have been developed for secure communication. Nevertheless, the most of them do not offer anonymity and function inadequately for SG communication. In this paper, we propose a robus key exchanged and authentication protocol for SG environment using elliptic curve cryptography. The proposed protocol provides anonymity and mutual authentication between participants in SG environment. In addition to an informal security analysis, we offer a formal security analysis of the proposed protocol based on the random oracle model. Further, we provide comparison of the security and functionality features of the proposed protocol with existing ECC-based protocols. A performance analysis in terms of computational and communication costs is carried out in comparison with existing dozen advanced authentication and key exchanged protocols, showing the superiority of the proposed protocol.

A modified path loss model known as PL-Collapsed along with complex collapsed structure layout has been used for proper reception of echo which provides the probable coverage for aforementioned scenario. Objectives have been realized with proper simulations. Then, we compare the results for various signal intensities, antenna gains and debris layers.

But we observe that most of the existing works of these applications are meant for simple indoor layout and are not adequate for complex cases, e.g., collapsed structures. In this article, we explore the feasibility of Wi-Fi Halow signals for the collapsed scenario as it can boost rescue efforts. To achieve this, we aim at two prime objectives of this article. First, we model debris constituent of common collapsed scenario materials, such as concrete, brick, glass, and lumber by conducting a field survey of an earthquake-affected area. After that, we consider signal propagation models for better coverage in this debris model by employing two methods. The first method is an integrated TOPSIS and Shannon entropy-based on a bijective soft set, which provides us an approximation tool to select the best Wi-Fi Halow signal coverage in debris. The second method composes two modified wireless signal propagation models, which are transmitter–receiver (TR) and Wi-Fi radar, respectively. We perform extensive simulations and figure out that low power transmission using Wi-Fi radar can yield better coverage, which is also verified by the Shannon entropy method.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an increased dependency of IoTs in our daily lives. Wi-Fi that was once a mode of Internet connectivity is also being used as IoT particularly Wi-Fi signals are acting like sensors. Currently, there are many novel applications of these signals as sensors such as breathing detection, sleep monitoring, indoor localization, human computer interaction to name a few. All these applications work for normal indoor environments as Wi-Fi signal is very weak to penetrate through heavy obstacles. This work investigates a similar problem of Wi-Fi signal coverage in complex environments such as collapsed structures. The objectives of this paper are first to consider a debris scenario and then Wi-Fi signal coverage in this collapsed structured debris model is to be worked out. We have proposed a novel Wi-Fi Radar approach which exploits the existing path loss models with radar range equation for computation of signal coverage. We predefine Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) threshold for various modulation schemes adopted for comparison to figure out the best case of signal reception. Further, we perform simulations on Wi-Fi Halow as Wi-Fi Radar to verify our approach. Moreover, we compare our results at various antenna gains, signal intensities and SNR thresholds. Comparison of results put emphasis on the low transmission power with better antenna gains to achieve the desired objective. This work paves way for the ubiquitous post-disaster rescue. This is because of the fact that signal coverage in collapsed structure may also exploit the concept of channel state information for breathing detection in the future.},

  abstract = {Recently, IoTs witnessed tremendous growth and have become integral to our daily lives. Wi-Fi, which was once a way of enabling convenient wireless access to the Internet, is now being used for various novel IoT applications. Researchers are focusing on exploiting the channel state information output from Wi-Fi and changing existing Wi-Fi infrastructure into a Wi-Fi radar which can be used for various applications. This paper proposes a novel Wi-Fi radar system placement approach for better coverage in collapsed structures. The objectives are first to find a debris environment followed by wireless signal mapping to debris and then to compute better Wi-Fi radar coverage with the signal to noise ratio larger than a predefined threshold. This method computes the coverage by single Wi-Fi based on WiFi radar approach and then partition the whole debris model into subregions until the coverage requirements are fulfilled. These subregions may be refined to create smaller subregions if there are heavy debris layers and coverage requirement cannot be met. Objectives have been achieved through proper simulations of newly introduced Wi-Fi Halow with attenuations of various materials based on the complexity of collapsed structure. Comparison of this work with existing techniques shows the novelty of this idea as Wi-Fi Halow is primarily for IoTs and can lead this work for a better solution in post-disaster rescue.},

The objectives of this paper are to first identify the possible collapsed structure environments and then to compute the effective distance coverage for license free ISM bands signals to have maximum coverage. This scheme discusses Wi-Fi signals behavior at three different frequencies i.e., 5GHz, 2.4GHz and 900MHz which is also termed as Wi-Fi Halow. We have employed modified path loss model termed as PLCollapsed for proper reception of echo that estimates the coverage range based on path losses encountered to Wi-Fi signal in these collapsed environments. The objectives have been achieved through proper simulations with different attenuation factors based on complexity of collapsed structure and are compared for aforementioned frequencies. Comparison of simulation results shows that Wi-Fi halow outperforms other frequencies and can be very effective for post-disaster rescue while replacing the traditional Doppler radar techniques hence paving way for more ubiquitous systems.},

A key component of .11ah is the Restricted Access Window (RAW), a new channel access mechanism, which reduces contention when even thousands of IoT devices operate in the same area by assigning them different channel times. This paper shows that existing studies incorrectly understand the RAW behavior, oversimplify its modeling and thereby overestimate the real system throughput in several times, especially for short durations of the reserved RAW slots. The core contribution of this paper is a new mathematical model based on a completely different approach, which yields more accurate results and thereby enables better IoT system dimensioning. The developed model is suitable for many scenarios typical for IoT. It allows finding RAW parameters that optimize system performance in terms of throughput, power consumption, and packet loss ratio. The proposed solution is can be used for various traffic patterns: when each device transmits a single packet, a batch of packets of random size, or it has full-buffer traffic.},

Various critical infrastructure monitoring scenarios require fast and reliable alert delivery. In such systems, multiple sensors are entrusted to react to the same emergency event. Thus, it is enough to receive an alert message from any of these sensors. However, such a message shall be reliably delivered as soon as possible. The recently published Wi-Fi HaLow standard defines the Restricted Access Window (RAW) mechanism that coordinates transmissions of numerous devices. Thus, it can improve reliability and reduce delays. The paper is the first to study the usage of RAW in a scenario of emergency alerts, where the alert shall be received from at least one sensor. The paper presents an easy-to-calculate mathematical model of alert delivery with RAW. The model allows dynamic online reconfiguration of RAW parameters to select such parameters that minimize consumed channel timeshare while providing satisfactory reliability and delivery delay for an alert. Intensive performance evaluation shows that the RAW is fruitful for mission-critical data delivery in the considered scenario.},

To handle routing of this massive traffic in a wireless network we require specialized, cost-effective routing devices and protocols. Transmitting IoT data over a wireless back-haul network using a single technology may lead to low throughput and increased delay due to high congestion. Critical IoT applications may not tolerate such a low throughput and high delay. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Routing via Multiple Paths and Multiple Technologies (RMPMT) protocol to realize the concept of Parallel Opportunistic Routing (POR) where multiple paths and multiple technologies are exploited in an IoT network to route the data. We have implemented the proposed RMPMT protocol by mounting multiple wireless interfaces (technologies) on Raspberry Pi and measured the effectiveness of the proposed protocol by transmitting data in real-time. Furthermore, we also propose a split window automatic repeat request to provide guaranteed packet delivery in multi-path and multi-technology environment.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) enabled wireless body area network (WBAN) is a novel technology that combines medical, wireless, and non-medical devices for healthcare management applications. Indoor healthcare institutions, such as hospitals, may employ IoT devices to manage medical equipment, maintain inventory, and monitor patients. In addition to monitoring temperature, humidity, and air quality, IoT sensors may help prevent the spread of sickness. The data generated by small sensor devices need strong security methods for secure transmission over a public network. Security of the data sent from source to destination is handled by transport layer security (TLS) protocol and prevent message loss or reordering. The most difficult component of TLS is determining how to handle reliability. Low-power wireless networks employ the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol to solve this problem. But if the Server is exposed to a malicious attack (i.e., flooded with ClientHello messages, the DTLS protocol may no longer serve the purpose) as it may lead to Denial-of-Service (DoS). The paper proposes an intelligent gateway-based verification and approval system to protect health data from IoT wearable devices, a key worldwide data security risk. Paper used Contiki Network Simulator for designing an advanced smart gateway-based constrained application Improved DTLS (CoAP I-DTLS) security protocol. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed work, the packet loss ratio is computed for the CoAP, CoAP-DTLS, and CoAP I-DTLS protocols. To assess the effectiveness of the improved CoAP I-DTLS, calculations are also made for data transfer and handshake time. Paper will also look at ways to increase security by integrating the CoAP I-DTLS protocol with the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-256) and utilizing Certificate Authority (CA) improvements. Evaluation parameters such as Packet loss ratio, Data transmission time, and Energy consumption average are considered and detailed simulation results have been presented.},

  abstract = {In this work, a novel Deep Learning model that combines Q Learning and Neural Networks is proposed and experimentally evaluated. The proposed scheme is developed in order to detect and tackle the effects of spectrum anomalies, which are unexpectedly appeared in ultra-dense Internet of Things (IoT) architectures. The protocol which is taken into consideration in this work, is the IEEE 802.11ah (Wi-Fi HaLow) and it is tested under strong interference, caused between wireless links which transmit in non-overlapping frequencies. The proposed approach trains a model that constantly observes the wireless environment and obtains an optimal policy for the transmission time parameter re-configurations of the participating devices. The experimental evaluation showcases that the proper training of the proposed Deep Q Learning model, leads to remarkable increased Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and throughput in the examined scenarios. Apart from the improvements (+35\%) observed on a PDR and throughput basis, the proposed algorithm also achieves overall higher channel utilization, increased transmission opportunities, and fairness in terms of channel access.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider a large-scale Wi-Fi HaLow heterogeneous network in a real-world Internet of Things (IoT) environment, where numerous devices are distributed around an access point (AP). These devices collect and transmit data using the restricted access window (RAW) mechanism. They exhibit varying traffic characteristics. Moreover, dependencies among the devices often exist. We aim to maximize the overall throughput by adjusting the RAW grouping decision. The heterogeneity of real network data and dependencies between devices make the RAW grouping process more complicated. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel traffic-driven RAW grouping approach. Specifically, we build a simulation environment based on real IoT data and NS-3. Then, we analyze the traffic characteristics of each IoT device. This analysis allows us to fully explore the dependencies and cooperation relationships among these devices. Hence, we can aggregate devices with these relationships into clusters. Each cluster is then treated as a supernode which is used as a basic unit for RAW grouping. Then, we use proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to optimize the RAW grouping process via interacting with the environment. Numerical results indicate that the proposed traffic-driven algorithm significantly achieves faster convergence and improves grouping efficiency in large-scale heterogeneous networks compared to baselines.},

  abstract = {Emerging technologies have accelerated the digitalization of smart grids, improving demand-side management, sustainability, and operational efficiency. The attack surface is widened by this interconnection, though, leaving vital smart grid data and systems vulnerable to online attacks. Single points of failure, privacy violations, and a lack of robustness against sophisticated attacks persist in centralized data processing. Traditional cryptographic techniques are further threatened by the development of quantum computing, which raises significant security risks for smart grids. With a focus on post-quantum cryptography (PQC) resilience, this study examines 206 peerreviewed research articles on blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) in smart grids that were published between January 2023 and July 2025. It assesses the advantages, limitations, and compromises of the current BFL models in this field. The paper suggests a unique post-quantum secure BFL (PQS-BFL) framework that integrates federated learning (FL), lightweight PQC protocols, and a scalable blockchain architecture to solve the vulnerabilities that have been uncovered. This design enables decentralized, private, and impenetrable cooperation among grid nodes. The results demonstrate that the system mitigates quantum-resilient attacks and inference threats while improving data integrity, key management, and secure model aggregation. A path for creating safe, scalable PQS-BFL solutions for upcoming smart energy systems is provided in the paper's conclusion, along with an overview of the main research issues. This study shows that using PQC, blockchain, and FL to secure next-generation smart grids is both feasible and important.},

  abstract = {In many wireless applications, antenna comes with variable sizes. The interest for small and compact antennas in wireless applications is increasing due to the mobility of the wireless devices. Internet of Things (IoT) defined as a network of small, low cost, low power, ubiquitous electronic devices. It is expected that WiFi proves to be one of the solutions for IoT technology. WiFi Alliance has introduced an unlicensed band of 900 MHz (HaLow) in 2017 to support IoT which requires low power, high data rate and long range. Hence, the demand for small antennas is substantial especially due to the booming industry in mobile communication. Generally, an antenna at low frequency exhibits large size of antenna. This paper presents the design of fractal dipole antennas for dual band wireless applications. The designs are based on hybrid Koch-Minkowski fractal method for the benefits of miniaturization. The antenna designs have been simulated using CST Microwave Studio and fabricated using Rogers 5880 substrate. Based on the results, it is observed that the fractal antennas are able to operate at dual frequencies, at 900 MHz and 2.6 GHz with return loss of 18dB and 16 dB respectively. The small size, thin and lightweight of antenna design (115 mm x 22.5 mm x 0.285 mm) makes it an attractive feature for compact wireless applications.},

As these components age and loads increase, the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into condition monitoring systems has emerged as a pivotal strategy to enhance asset reliability, enable predictive maintenance, and minimize unplanned outages. This systematic review explores the current landscape of IoT-enabled condition monitoring in power transformers, synthesizing technological advances across sensor deployment, edge and cloud computing architectures, communication protocols, machine learning diagnostics, and cybersecurity frameworks. A total of 84 peer-reviewed articles, published between 2010 and 2024, were analyzed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Key findings indicate a strong emphasis on thermal and gas-based sensors, with fiber-optic temperature sensors and dissolved gas analysis remaining the most dominant diagnostic tools. Edge computing and lightweight AI models are increasingly used to filter and process data in real time, while LoRaWAN and NB-IoT have emerged as the communication protocols of choice in remote substations. Furthermore, machine learning—particularly support vector machines, decision trees, CNNs, and LSTMs—has advanced from exploratory modeling to deployment-ready applications for fault classification and health indexing. Despite these advancements, significant gaps persist in the integration of cybersecurity protocols and adherence to regulatory standards, highlighting a critical need for secure and compliant system architectures. This review contributes a comprehensive and structured analysis of the state-of-the-art approaches in the field, providing insights for researchers, utility operators, and policymakers aiming to modernize power transformer management within the broader context of smart grid infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Microservices have allowed the decomposition of large monoliths and introduced the simple responsibility principle into its essence. It allowed complex systems to be more cost efficient and easily scalable. With this new architecture, new vulnerabilities were introduced, such as the large surface that started to get exposed to the internet. Instead of having one monolithic surface exposed, we started to have several small services exposed. New patterns were introduced to try to diminish these threats and among them the “API Gateway'' pattern was introduced. The purpose of this article is to further explore the API Gateway pattern, and to further enhance the microservices communication security as part of that pattern. This research proposes a hybrid approach, using HTTPS and JWT only when strictly necessary, towards overcoming those recognized limitations of security and performance. Furthermore, proof of concept on top of NB-IoT communication protocol was developed. It intends to explore the transmission of a large quantity of low-frequency data from devices to the cloud, while the communication maintains effective and with low latency. The created supporting microservices API followed the proposed architecture and was tested against security attacks towards mitigating its impacts.},

  abstract = {In incineration plants, indoor positioning systems are needed to prevent workers from approaching hazardous areas and to facilitate rescue operations in emergencies. Although many positioning systems using signal strength indicators such as Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) have been proposed, the vast interior of incineration plants increases the cost of constructing a communication infrastructure using 5GHz Wi-Fi. Therefore, by adopting Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), which allows for long-distance communication, the number of Access points (APs) that need to be installed in the environment can be reduced, thus lowering the cost of constructing the communication infrastructure. IEEE 802.11ah (11ah) is a new LPWA standard that uses the Sub-GHz band. In this study, we deployed new 11ah receivers in an incineration plant where IEEE 802.11ac (11ac) is already established and evaluated their coverage and area classification performance. The experiment demonstrated that the entire incineration plant can be covered with fewer units compared to 11ac. Additionally, when a small number of 11ah receivers were installed, the system identified individual rooms with higher accuracy than 11ac, suggesting that 11ah RSSI is a promising feature that can be obtained at low cost.},

To minimize service costs, it is essential to optimize the lifetime of objects, which are often powered by unreliable energy sources. This optimization must be based on finely-tuned energy consumption models and those generally proposed in the literature do not take into account all the specificities of the transmission of a connected object. In this article, a refined power consumption model based on in-situ measurements is proposed for an 802.11ah station. This improved model takes into account the number of nodes in the network, the number of retransmission attempts and the various exchanges linked to the higher communication layers. The results show the influence of the number of stations in an 802.11ah network on a station’s energy consumption, and demonstrate that the maximum number is limited by the probability of successful transmission.},

Typically, approaches deal with them separately, which might cause sub-optimality. Furthermore, assuming the fixed location of the cloudlets will limit the dynamic adaptability of the problem. Enabling more optimality and adaptability to the dynamic nature of cloudlet-based computing, we propose a novel Variable-Length multi-objective Whale optimization Integrated with Differential Evolution designated as VL-WIDE. Unlike the existing optimization algorithm, VL-WIDE features the capability of searching different lengths of solutions to cover the variable number of cloudlets for deployment. Furthermore, it enables a non-dominated evaluation of solutions based on four objectives using crowding distance for selection. It provides an application-oriented solutions repair operator for repairing non-valid solutions and assuring that all solutions are generated in the feasible region. The proposed algorithm enables moving the cloudlets among pre-defined locations to increase the quality of service according to the change in the user density caused by user mobility. Comparing this developed algorithm with other algorithms shows its superiority in multi-objective optimization (MOO) evaluation metrics. VL-WIDE has provided the best in a number of non-dominated solutions and delta metrics and was competitive in other metrics.},

These technologies include standardized IEEE 802.15.4g/Wi-SUN, IEEE 802.11ah/Wi-Fi HaLow, and proprietary SigFox, LoRaWAN and others. These communication technologies use lower frequencies than conventional Wi-Fi in the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands and are used in critical infrastructure such as smart meters in addition to applications such as sensor data collection, environmental monitoring and surveillance cameras for security. However, performance degradation has been observed on IEEE 802.15.4g in environments where IEEE 802.15.4g devices are densely deployed with other interfering devices.

Accordingly, new coexistence mechanisms are needed.

The review also discusses the challenges associated with protocol selection, integration, and deployment in resourceconstrained environments. Furthermore, emerging trends such as the convergence of edge computing, 5G connectivity, and enhanced security frameworks are examined for their impact on the evolution of M2M communication. The paper concludes by outlining future research directions, including the need for adaptive and intelligent protocol frameworks capable of addressing dynamic application requirements.

  abstract = {Events such as catastrophes and disasters are, in most cases, unpredictable. Consequently, reusing existing infrastructures to develop alternative communication strategies after disasters is essential to minimise the impact of these events on the population’s ability to communicate and promptly receive alerts from authorities. In this context, the emergence of smart cities, characterised by dense and geographically distributed IoT networks, presents significant potential for such reuse. This work proposes HaLert, a resilient architecture for smart cities based on a Wi-Fi HaLow IEEE 802.11s mesh network, whose resources can be readily reallocated to support a emergency communication system to exchange messages (including text, location, image, audio, and video) between citizens, authorities, and between both parties. To facilitate remote monitoring and configuration of the network, the architecture incorporates the SDN (Software-Defined Networking) paradigm, supported by a LoRa controlled flooding mesh network. A prototype was developed based on this architecture and tested in a real urban scenario comprising both indoor and outdoor environments. The results demonstrated that, despite the significant impact of obstacles, lack of line-of-sight, and terrain slopes on the latency (average latency between 15 and 54.8 ms) and throughput (upload bitrates between 134 and 726 Kbps and download bitrates between 117 and 682 Kbps) of the Wi-Fi HaLow network, it remained stable and resilient, successfully providing all functionalities associated with the HaLert architecture. The tests conducted on the LoRa network revealed a high average message success rate of 94.96\%.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new application of the IEEE 802.11ah standard, commonly called Wi-Fi HaLow, for the configuration of networks through Software-Defined Networking (SDN). The proposed architecture aims to leverage the flexibility of SDN to configure and monitor network equipment in a dedicated autonomous Wi-Fi HaLow network using an IEEE 802.11s mesh topology. In this way, this technology and topology increase the control range of the network, thus providing better redundancy of the network while being able to provide enough speed for several current use cases, including real-time IoT solutions where the data volume is higher. The system uses a multi-tenant architecture with Wi-Fi HaLow devices and permits the dynamic configuration of several production networks through a single separated configuration network. The prototype of the proposed architecture and mesh connection tests were implemented using devices with the Newracom 7292 chipset. The prototype was employed for functional tests, while mesh connection tests were conducted to evaluate range and bitrate. The results show that the network is capable of efficiently handling low-to-moderate data traffic at a distance as large as 1.1 km in an indoor environment, showing great flexibility and long-range connectivity through mesh networking.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) detects context through sensors capturing data from dynamic physical environments, in order to inform automation decisions within cyber physical systems (CPS). Diverse types of uncertainty in the IoT pipeline can propagate within and across nodes, involving complex interactions with security, privacy, and trust that remain largely unexplored. This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the types of uncertainties in IoT and how they propagate within IoT nodes and networks. We consider adversarial uncertainty in the context of distributed IoT networks to capture perturbations due to malicious actors in the network that can influence IoT security, privacy and trust. We examine the propagation of adversarial uncertainty and well-known uncertainty types, namely aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, within the five distinct stages of sensing, communication, storage, processing and decision-making in an IoT pipeline, across network layer boundaries, and across nodes within an IoT network. Using this mapping, we analyse the interactions between the uncertainty types and their propagation, and security, privacy, and trust in IoT. Based on this analysis, we discuss guidelines and considerations for mitigating uncertainty in IoT through a smart grid use case study.},

  abstract = {In today's world, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role to interconnect all the devices and improve the overall Quality of Life (QoL) for people. The main concern among IoT systems revolve around three pillars namely security, confidentiality, and privacy owing to the sensitive nature of the data being transmitted and processed byIoT devices. Traditional cryptographic approaches address these concerns by ensuring the authenticity and confidentiality of IoT systems. However, the majority of IoT devices are resource-constrained, which implies that they operate under significant resource constraints such as limited computational power, constrained battery life, physical compactness, and restricted memory capacity. To this end, Lightweight cryptography (LWC) offers methods specifically designed to accommodate the limitations of resource-constrained IoT devices. This work establishes the role of light weight cryptography for such resource constrained IoT networks in terms of security perspectives. In this work, we explore the security vulnerabilities of IoT systems and the associated lightweight cryptographic methods highlighting four components namely lightweight block ciphers, lightweight stream ciphers, hash functions, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography. The work further discusses the role of LWC and reviews the recent advancements in different sectors of IoT such as smart city, industries, healthcare, smart grids, and agriculture. Finally, several open research directions are highlighted in order to guide future LWC and IoT researchers.},

However, ensuring reliable connectivity in diverse agricultural environments remains a critical challenge. This paper analyzes the performance trade-offs between Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN)—specifically LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, and Sigfox—and cellular networks (4G/5G) in agricultural applications. Beyond a comprehensive literature review (2020–2024), this study evaluates hybrid LPWAN–5G architectures that integrate the strengths of both network types to enhance cost-efficiency and connectivity reliability. Using real-world case studies, the findings demonstrate that hybrid LPWAN–5G models can reduce connectivity costs by up to 30\% while significantly improving network reliability in remote agricultural settings.

  abstract = {The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is an open standard routing protocol defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to address the constraints of IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN). RPL is susceptible to various attacks, including isolation attacks, in which a node or a set of RPL nodes can be isolated from the rest of the network. Three significant isolation attacks are the black hole attack (BHA), selective forwarding attack (SFA), and destination advertisement object (DAO) inconsistency attack (DAO-IA). In a BHA, a malicious node drops all packets intended for transmission silently. In an SFA, a malicious node forwards only selected packets and drops the other received packets. In a DAO-IA, a malicious node drops the received data packet and replies with a forwarding error packet, causing the parent node to discard valid downward routes from the routing table. We review the literature on proposed mechanisms, propose a taxonomy, and analyze the features, limitations, and performance metrics of existing mechanisms. Researchers primarily focus on power consumption as the key performance metric when mitigating BHA (47\%), SFA (51\%), and DAO-IA (100\%), with downward latency being the least addressed metric for BHA (4\%) and SFA (3\%), and control packet overhead being the least addressed for DAO-IA (37\%). Finally, we discuss the unresolved issues and research challenges in mitigating RPL isolation attacks.},

This study analyzes the viability of Wi-Fi HaLow in Indonesia and its interaction with other IoT technologies, such as LoRaWAN, under interference conditions. Two scenarios are examined: interference from Wi-Fi HaLow to a LoRaWAN gateway and vice versa, using SEAMCAT software at 923 MHz. In this scenario, Wi-Fi HaLow serves as the interfering system, while LoRaWAN experiences disruption. The power variations of Wi-Fi HaLow were tested to identify the most efficient. Results show no interference at 8 km with 24 and 25 dBm, but interference occurs at 10 km with 26 dBm. Additionally, interference tests with varying numbers of Wi-Fi HaLow access points (APs) revealed minimal interference when the distance between the systems was 9 km, with interference rates ranging from 20\% to 100\%.},

Also PLC will serve the infrastructure on the sensor/actuator side when the energy requirement cannot be fulfilled by autonomous battery and capacitor based nodes. PLC may provide the numerous bridges necessary to sustain a long lifetime (years) for the WSN infrastructures. This new role of PLC networking will be possible only if the inter-operability between all media and technology is made possible. Thanks to the design of converging IPv6 networking layers, we show that full inter-operability is already possible even in very tiny constrained networking devices. Moreover, low energy PLC, will be able to provide smart grid monitoring without impacting the overall energy balance.},

This study evaluates the performance of a Wi-Fi HaLow Extender-based Internet of Things (IoT) system for soil moisture monitoring. Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, including packet loss, delay, and jitter, were tested at distances of 65 m, 105 m, 160 m, 215 m, 230 m, 300 m, and 450 m, following ITU-T G.1010 standards. Results showed 0\% packet loss at all distances (Very Good), delays between 1.21 ms and 1.71 ms (Very Good), and jitter ranging from 1.20 ms to 1.72 ms (Good). Stable communication was achieved up to 300 m, with slight degradation at 450 m. The YL-69 soil moisture sensor validation yielded a maximum error of 3.7\%, confirming acceptable accuracy. Overall, the system demonstrated reliable, energy-efficient, and low-latency data transmission, making it suitable for large-scale agricultural deployment to support sustainable smart farming.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) landscape is hindered by a critical challenge: the lack of semantic interoperability among diverse data models. Existing IoT solutions often function as isolated “data silos”, impeding the seamless integration of heterogeneous data sources crucial for informed decision-making and streamlined processes. This research addresses this issue by introducing a pioneering solution: the semantic interoperability support system (SISS). SISS is an innovative tool designed to bridge the semantic divide between disparate data models within a common application domain. To address the lack of interoperability between current IoT platforms, devices, and solutions that use native data models, SISS facilitates integration by enabling the generation of gateways or translator components. These components establish mappings between the semantic properties of source and target data models, leveraging advanced semantic analysis and inference techniques. The core principle underpinning SISS is its ability to discern and map the semantic content of data models. Through a meticulous analysis of the temporal and spatial dimensions inherent in the data, SISS establishes meaningful connections. This innovative approach fosters interoperability and enables a deeper understanding of the underlying information, enhancing the potential for data-driven insights. This article delves into the pervasive issue of semantic interoperability in the current IoT paradigm and presents SISS as a transformative solution. By emphasizing its ability to transcend the limitations of existing solutions and its methodology to generate mappings between disparate data models, this research contributes to the achievement of global semantic interoperability in IoT.},

This paper presents a practical performance evaluation of Wi-Fi HaLow (IEEE 802.11ah) using off-the-shelf hardware, focusing on application-level energy efficiency and throughput across varying distances emulated via the free-space path loss (FSPL) model. Our experiments demonstrate energy per bit (EPB) as low as 27 nJ bit−1 (and 45 nJ bit−1 at an equivalent 158 m) and effective bit rates (EBR) from 0.15 Mbit s−1 to 18 Mbit s−1 over FSPL-calculated distances up to nearly 50 km. A key contribution is the quantitative analysis of HaLow’s potential to enhance a wind turbine blade monitoring Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), projecting a two-fold EPB reduction and a tenfold EBR increase compared to BLE. These findings provide critical benchmarks for HaLow’s practical deployment, underscoring its capacity to enable demanding IoT applications by uniquely balancing range, data rate, and power efficiency, thereby addressing limitations of existing wireless technologies.},

  abstract = {A number of industrial wireless technologies have emerged over the last decade, promising to replace the need for wires in a variety of use cases. Except for customized time division multiple access (TDMA)-based wireless technologies that can achieve ultralow latency over a very limited area, wireless communication generally has reliability and latency issues when it comes to industrial applications. Closed loop communication requires high reliability (over 99\%), limited jitter and latency, which poses a challenge especially over a wide area measuring in hundreds of meters. Extended coverage is promised with the advent of sub-GHz technologies, one of them being IEEE 802.11ah which is the only one that offers sufficient data rate for frequent bidirectional communication. Thus, we evaluated IEEE 802.11ah for low-latency time-critical control loops. We propose the network setup for adjusting the network dynamics to that of control loops, enabling limited jitter and high reliability. We explore the scalability of IEEE 802.11ah network hosting both control loops and monitoring sensors that periodically transmit measurements. Assigning the control loop end-nodes to dedicated restricted access window (RAW) slot results in over 99.99\% successful deliveries. Furthermore, interpacket delay is concentrated around the cycle-time in the following or preceding beacon interval in case the beacon interval is at least half the value of the shortest cycle-time. Adjusting the beacon interval to the fastest control loop in the network ensures latency requirements at the cost of maximum achievable throughput and energy consumption.},

  abstract = {Recently, the Wi-Fi alliance announced a new Wi-Fi standard known as IEEE 802.11ah (or Wi-Fi HaLow) to efficiently support Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the existing registration method under IEEE 802.11ah, based on carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), was analyzed as not efficient enough for registration of large-scale machine-to-machine (M2M) communications where a massive number of devices try to access a single, centralized access point (AP). In this paper, we propose a hybrid slotted-CSMA/CA–time-division multiple access (TDMA) (HSCT) medium access control (MAC) protocol for efficient massive registration of IoT devices (up to 8000) in M2M networks. We focus on situations, where a large number of M2M devices simultaneously try to register at a single, centralized AP. In the proposed HSCT, contention-based slotted-CSMA/CA allows devices to send an authentication request via randomly selected backoff slots, whereas contention-free TDMA permits those devices to send/receive the subsequent association request/association response via an individually allocated TDMA slot. In addition, a centralized authentication control (CAC)-based mechanism with modified algorithms for optimal selection of CAC parameters and the slotted fixed-window CSMA protocol with Sift geometric probability distribution are used to mitigate severe contention between massive registrations upon network (re-)initialization from an AP reboot. This paper also analyzes the performance of the proposed scheme and determines the optimal configuration to enhance registration performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HSCT MAC protocol achieves substantial improvement, compared with the contention-free transmission, a combined authentication/association scheme, and the conventional IEEE 802.11ah with CSMA/CA.},

  abstract = {Transformers are pivotal components in power distribution for electrical grids as they directly affect the reliability and efficiency of energy delivery. Effective maintenance of transformers decreases energy losses, improves the grid’s reliability, and contributes to sustainable energy management aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. Conventional methods focus on onsite guarantee inspections, showing blind or gut-feeling maintenance, rather than well-defined maintenance management systems. These limitations have triggered the use and development of IoT and wireless technologies for the remote health monitoring of transformers. The authors designed a smart gateway based on LoRa technology that monitors transformers’ health in real-time. The system integrates two hardware nodes. The first one is the Transformer Health Data Collection Node, which collects operational data that include, but are not limited to, voltage, current, temperature, humidity, and vibration through various sensors. The second one is the LoRa Gateway Node, which processes and uploads the information collected to Blynk Cloud. The Blynk Cloud application allows grid operators to visualize the data in real-time, thus enabling prompt attention to maintenance actions and diagnosing faults within the grid. The system was designed to consume low power and transmit data over long distances while providing reliable remote control using LoRa RF and ESP-01 WiFi. This approach resolves issues related to low energy consumption and access limitations while improving the power systems’ monitoring methods. Moreover, with the aid of cloud computing, it is no longer necessary for workers to supervise the site constantly, which improves efficiency and scalability while also lowering costs. This document describes the specifics of system architecture, the design of devices, the communication protocols used for data exchange, and the interface for monitoring the cloud system. These changes in IoT allow for improving the maintenance of transformers, shortening the downtime needed for repairs, and increasing the reliability of the power distribution arteries with thorough data analysis and real-time monitoring.},

The adoption of IoT networks still faces several challenges, despite the rapid advancement of low-power communication technology. Homogenizing this sector requires allowing interoperability between many technologies, which is now one of the largest obstacles. In this article, we present the design and implementation of the hybrid LPWAN architecture that can accomplish wide-area communication coverage and low-power consumption for IoT applications by leveraging two LPWAN technologies, Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Network (Wi-SUN) and Long Range (LoRa). In particular, LoRa is used for long-range communication, and Wi-SUN for a low-latency mesh network. Additionally, we implemented smart street light controlling system as a real-world deployment at the university campus to showcase the efficiency of the hybrid network. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid LPWAN architecture provides a better coverage and capacity while consuming less power than that of the LoRa or Wi-SUN network. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid LPWAN architecture as a viable solution for next-generation IoT applications.},

With a growing population of resource-constrained IoT devices, meeting various communication requirements in dynamic and dense wireless networks has become a significant problem. Long Range (LoRa) was designed for LPWAN, which features long-distance communication, low-power consumption, and simultaneous transmission of multiple end devices. However, LoRa deployment in dense IoT networks facing several challenges like interference, scalability, security, and reliability. In recent times numerous techniques have been developed for interference mitigation. As these techniques used a range of methodologies to address the interference challenge, it is necessary to thoroughly analyze current solutions. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on interference issues and the solution approaches in LoRa. Initially, the challenges in dense IoT networks are discussed. We next present the fundamentals of LoRa and the classification of interference in the different categories. In each type of interference, the available methodologies are categorized based on their solution approaches. The analysis of different solution approaches is summarized by examining various issues of the LoRa network. Finally, the open issues and future directions related to the interference in the LoRa network are discussed.},

  abstract = {The sinkhole attack is one of the most damaging threats in the Internet of Things (IoT). It deceptively attracts neighboring nodes and initiates malicious activity, often disrupting the network when combined with other attacks. This study proposes a novel approach, named NADSA, to detect and isolate sinkhole attacks. NADSA is based on the RPL protocol and consists of two detection phases. In the first phase, the minimum possible hop count between the sender and receiver is calculated and compared with the sender’s reported hop count. The second phase utilizes the number of DIO messages to identify suspicious nodes and then applies a fuzzification process using RSSI, ETX, and distance measurements to confirm the presence of a malicious node. The proposed method is extensively simulated in highly lossy and sparse network environments with varying numbers of nodes. The results demonstrate that NADSA achieves high efficiency, with PDRs of 68\%, 70\%, and 73\%; E2EDs of 81, 72, and 60 ms; TPRs of 89\%, 83\%, and 80\%; and FPRs of 24\%, 28\%, and 33\%. NADSA outperforms existing methods in challenging network conditions, where traditional approaches typically degrade in effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Smart grids are transforming electricity network management through the use of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). They facilitate the balance between production and consumption of electricity by providing real-time data and consumption control for the Distribution System Operator (DSO). However, the implementation details, which are often proprietary, are not readily available. This demo presents an innovative visualization platform to simulate a Low Voltage (LV) residential network of 48 smart meters. The platform provides a visual understanding of the communication dynamics in an AMI by reproducing message exchanges and simulating link disruptions. This demo presents the state-of-the-art G3-PLC protocol stack currently employed in the French AMI deployment and demonstrates the transmission of routing and application messages generated by LOADng and DLMS/COSEM, respectively.},

  abstract = {Background. Digital Twins (DTs) are dynamic virtual representations of physical systems, enabled by seamless, bidirectional communication between the physical and digital realms. Among the challenges impeding the widespread adoption of DTs is the absence of a universally accepted definition and a standardized DT Reference Architecture (RA). Existing state-of-the-art architectures remain largely domain-specific, primarily emphasizing aspects like modeling and simulation. Furthermore, they often combine structural and dynamic elements into unified, all-in-one diagrams, which adds to the ambiguity and confusion surrounding the concept of Digital Twins. Objective. To address these challenges, this work aims to contribute a domain-independent, multi-view Digital Twin Reference Architecture that can help practitioners in architecting and engineering their DTs. Method. We adopted the design science methodology, structured into three cycles: (i) an initial investigation conducting a Systematic Literature Review to identify key architectural elements, (ii) preliminary design refined via feedback from practitioners, and (iii) final artifact development, integrating knowledge from widely adopted DT development platforms and validated through an expert survey of 20 participants. Results. The proposed Digital Twin Reference Architecture is named TwinArch. It is documented using the Views and Beyond methodology by the Software Engineering Institute. TwinArch website and replication package: https://alessandrasomma28.github.io/twinarch/. Conclusion. TwinArch offers practitioners practical artifacts that can be utilized for designing and developing new DT systems across various domains. It enables customization and tailoring to specific use cases while also supporting the documentation of existing DT systems.},

The objective of this study is to enhance the model interpretability and detection accuracy of DDoS attacks in EVCS using the Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) technique. The research makes use of an IoT attack dataset with 33 attacks that were carried out over 105 devices in a topology that was divided into seven different categories. Using the Firefly Algorithm, the suggested PFL method selects a subset of features wisely to maximize the performance of the classification model. Promising outcomes are seen in the evaluation of several machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), K-Nearest Neighbors, and Multilayer Perceptron. GBM and Random Forest demonstrate their promise for efficient DDoS detection in EVCS by achieving high accuracy rates of 99\% and 98\%, respectively, in detecting DDoS attacks. The overall detection performance is further improved by the feature selection model, which also increases the efficiency and interpretability of the classification model. These results imply that machine learning models can improve the security and resilience of EVCS against DDoS attacks when combined with the PFL technique.},

  abstract = {Most wireless communication technologies for Internet of Things (IoT) applications face the bottleneck of dense and large-scale use cases. One solution to this problem is a periodic channel reservation strategy, in which only a small group of stations can compete for channel access during a given period. The IEEE 802.11ah standard, a.k.a. Wi-Fi HaLow, deploys this idea in its channel access protocol, named Restricted Access Window (RAW). A single RAW consists of one or more RAW slots during which only designated stations can contend for channel access. This paper considers an IEEE 802.11ah-based network with randomly distributed stations around the Access Point (AP), operating under a Rayleigh-fading channel with capture enabled. We develop an analytical model to evaluate the contention of a group of stations and propose a Load-Aware Channel Allocation (LACA) algorithm for the RAW slot period. The LACA algorithm ensures the delivery of all packets that designated stations carry, allowing for the allocation of load-aware RAW slots, which is effective in enhancing the Age of Information (AoI). We evaluate the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and channel usage within a pre-allocated RAW slot to prove the effectiveness of our proposal. We further study the impact of the spatial distribution of the stations around the AP and the capture effect under a Rayleigh channel on the performance of the proposed LACA algorithm. Extensive simulations are used to validate our analytical results. Our proposal provides a load-aware and adaptive channel allocation scheme based on the dynamic conditions of the network. Our model can be implemented in a global configuration scheme for the RAW mechanism in heterogeneous networks or for alternative communication technologies that address dense scenarios with the integration of periodic channel reservations.},

  abstract = {Over the past 25 years, IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) has played a vital role in last-mile Internet connectivity. The Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah) standard marks a significant leap, offering long-range, lowpower connectivity, particularly suited for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Operating in sub-1 GHz frequencies, Wi-Fi HaLow extends coverage up to 1 km. However, deploying multi-hop HaLow mesh networks for ground-level Human-to-Human (H2H) communication presents unique challenges, as the standard primarily supports star and tree topologies. This paper introduces the WiLongH hand-held platform, designed for long-range Wi-Fi HaLow mesh networks aimed at H2H communication at ground level. Utilizing commercial hardware, open-source software, IEEE 802.11s mesh, and the B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced Routing Protocol (batman-adv) with custom radio profiles, the platform was tested across various environments, including indoor, outdoor, urban, and multi-level parking settings. Results demonstrate that the platform supports voice call ranges exceeding 1 km and video call ranges up to 800 m in line-of-sight conditions, with throughputs of 420 Kbps and 700 Kbps, respectively. In complex urban environments (300-700 m), it achieved up to 64\% success for voice calls and 30\% for video calls using a 1 MHz channel bandwidth with two nodes. Connectivity across 3-4 floors in basement parking revealed the need for additional mesh nodes. The platform’s multicast audio performance showed near-optimal forwarding, outperforming traditional flooding techniques, with 4-node multi-hop performance tested in outdoor and indoor settings. A dense mesh network setup of 14 nodes in an indoor arena further validated the scalability of the platform. Moreover, the use of a SAW filter in the US band (902-928 MHz) significantly reduced cellular interference, enhancing voice and video call performance by 15-20\% and 7-10\%, respectively. Additionally, the WiLongH platform demonstrated a 33\% improvement in battery life compared to conventional long-range Wi-Fi mesh systems.},

The new Restricted Access Window (RAW) mechanism promises to increase throughput and energy efficiency by dividing stations into different RAW groups. Only the stations in the same group can access the channel simultaneously, which reduces collision probability in dense scenarios. However, the draft does not specify any RAW grouping algorithms, while the grouping strategy is expected to severely impact RAW performance. To study the impact of parameters such as traffic load, number of stations and RAW group duration on optimal number of RAW groups, we implemented a sub-1Ghz PHY model and the 802.11ah MAC protocol in ns-3 to evaluate its transmission range, throughput, latency and energy efficiency in dense IoT network scenarios. The simulation shows that, with appropriate grouping, the RAW mechanism substantially improves throughput, latency and energy efficiency. Furthermore, the results suggest that the optimal grouping strategy depends on many parameters, and intelligent RAW group adaptation is necessary to maximize performance under dynamic conditions. This paper provides a major leap towards such a strategy.},

  abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoTs) transforms industries through instantaneous data sharing, the rapid increase in interconnected devices presents significant challenges to efficient resource allocation. The primary objectives of IoTs include achieving high performance, minimizing latency, reducing energy consumption, and ensuring security. This paper examines key techniques aimed at enhancing effective resource management within IoTs. More sophisticated optimization is crucial for the diverse array of devices with varying capabilities and power requirements in IoTs networks. The leading techniques discussed are heuristic algorithms, machine learning-based models, game-theoretic models, and hybrid approaches. Heuristic algorithms like Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) provide relatively quick near-optimal solutions and are especially vital given the dynamic conditions encountered in IoTs. Additional applications include simulated annealing and Tabu Search (TS) for optimization in constrained local search. Advanced resource allocation facilitated by learning and adaptation through machine learning enables the development of models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memories (LSTMs), and Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). Reinforcement Learning (RL) helps IoT systems acquire accurate policies over time. Data analytics are streamlined with frameworks like Apache Spark and Hadoop, making real-time processing and resource management more efficient. In addition to crafting strategies for equitable and stable resource distribution, game-theoretic models explore the interactions among devices and networks within constructs such as Nash equilibrium. Hybrid strategies that merge heuristic methods with machine learning approaches offer an effective solution for addressing multi-objective optimization. Ongoing research will continue to evolve to enhance the adaptability of resource distribution in IoTs networks, focusing on federated learning, Blockchain, and edge computing.},

  abstract = {Despite unprecedented advancements, wireless local area network (WLAN) technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT), such as IEEE 802.11ah (i.e., WiFi-HaLow), are prone to serious security threats, owing to their constrained computational and memory resources, which limit the use of heavyweight intrusion protection and security protocols. To address this problem, security administrators (sec-admins) must perform regular and comprehensive vulnerability assessments of IoT devices. An Internet-wide port scan (IWPS) is the initial step. However, the medium access control mechanism of IEEE 802.11ah, designed specifically for heterogeneous IoT traffic and low-power operations, can degrade network performance in the case of traditional port-scan traffic. Moreover, Internet-security (IPSec) protocol support is mandatory for IPv6-enabled IoT devices to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Although the objective of a port scan is to improve IoT security, the resultant network performance can adversely affect IPSec services. Therefore, in this study, we optimize the IWPS to maximize the IoT security over IEEE 802.11ah WLAN. To this end, we propose novel mathematical models to evaluate IoT security based on portscan network performance and IPsec services, which derives an optimal scan rate for sec-admins. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified by comprehensive numerical analysis, which shows that our approach minimizes the risk to IoT devices while probing them at an optimal scan rate.},

However, the inappropriate application of RAW for different groups of devices would increase uplink energy consumption and decrease data rate. In this paper, we study an energy efficient RAW optimization problem for IEEE 802.11ah based uplink communications. We first present a novel retransmission scheme that utilizes the next empty slot to retransmit for collided devices, and formulate the problem based on overall energy consumption and the data rate of each RAW by applying probability theory and Markov Chain. Then, we derive the energy efficiency of the uplink transmission. Last but not the least, an energy-aware window control algorithm to adapt the RAW size is proposed to optimize the energy efficiency by identifying the number of slots in each RAW for different group scales. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing RAW on uplink energy efficiency and delivery ratio.},

It proposes the Restricted Access Window (RAW) mechanism, where stations (sensors) are partitioned into groups for time-division channel access. The grouping strategy, which highly influences network performance, needs to consider factors including the number of stations per group, and stations’ data rates, and locations. With the advance of artificial intelligence technologies, we ponder whether deep learning can help solving this station grouping problem.

More precisely, the model predicts the corresponding throughputs and packet loss rates of a given set of RAW configurations. Thus, based on the predicted results, we can determine proper RAW parameters. We have validated the proposed method by ns-3 simulations.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and the fifth generation mobile communication technology, as well as the in-depth promotion of the concept of cloud-edge collaboration, the construction of the “cloud-edge-end” integration architecture in the field of industrial Internet of things has made remarkable progress, which has brought profound changes to the traditional manufacturing industry. In the practical application process of this architecture, the complexity of end-side device management and data interaction exposes many shortcomings of the existing technology, especially for the software management of industrial intelligent gateway, there is still a lack of systematic solutions. As a key node connecting the cloud and industrial field devices, industrial intelligent gateway plays an important role in data collection, protocol conversion, edge computing and device linkage, etc. However, the current management platform generally has problems such as single strategy, low efficiency and insufficient compatibility when dealing with the upgrade requirements of highly customized devices. This study proposed and optimized an intelligent gateway software management platform based on the “cloud-edge-end” architecture, combined with the typical scenarios of small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises, designed the platform architecture with strong versatility, defined the functional modules and task division, and established the node organization form of “one gateway and multiple devices” through the industrial visual quality inspection project to verify its rationality. In order to solve the bottleneck problem of software upgrade, this paper innovatively proposes the large file transfer mechanism combining block and breakpoint continuation, the upgrade rollback strategy based on “three-mesh backup”, and the efficient transmission algorithm of dynamically adjusting bandwidth, and the optimization scheme supporting differential update, which greatly improves the upgrade efficiency and stability. With Jenkins cluster management tool, the platform realizes the automation of task construction and batch deployment, and ensures the reliability of the upgrade process through the end-to-end security check script. The practical application and test results show that the platform has excellent performance in functional perfection, operational reliability and scenario adaptation, which provides strong support for the popularization of industrial intelligent gateway and the further development of “cloud-edge-end” collaborative architecture.},

A key feature of Wi-Fi HaLow is the Target Wake Time (TWT) mechanism, which allows devices to schedule wake-up times, significantly reducing IDLE listening and energy consumption. However, there is currently no energy consumption model, leaving a gap in calculating how much energy a device actually consumes in a real network. This study aims to bridge this gap by developing a forecast model to accurately predict the energy consumption of devices with TWT enabled. The proposed model is then validated through experimental measurements using real Wi-Fi HaLow-compatible devices, ensuring an accurate representation of practical energy consumption. This research provides empirical insights and recommendations for optimizing network configurations in battery-constrained environments.

The utilization of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) stack enhances the integration of web protocols and sensor networks, leading to greater accessibility. However, the BGP protocol stack introduces substantial overhead to messages transmitted at each layer, resulting in increased data overhead and energy consumption in networks by several orders of magnitude. This paper proposes a method to reduce the overhead on small and medium-sized packets. In multi-temporal networks utilizing BGP, scheduling and aggregating BGP packets at sensor nodes help achieve specific objectives. Various research methodologies and measures are employed to facilitate this, including request classification, BGP response prioritization within the network, determination of maximum acceptable delay, and overall network management. Synchronization and temporal integration of received messages at sensor nodes are performed, considering the maximum allowable delay for each message and the availability of the destination to process the accumulated messages. The evaluation results of the proposed method demonstrate a significant reduction in energy consumption and network traffic, particularly in monitoring applications within multi-stage networks. The protocol stack used is derived from the BGP standard.},

  abstract = {Modern grids have adopted advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) technology to facilitate bidirectional communication between smart meters and control centers. This enables smart meters to report their fine-grained consumption values at predefined intervals to utility providers for various purposes, including demand balancing, load forecasting, dynamic billing, and operational efficiency. Compared to traditional power grids, smart grids offer advantages such as enhanced reliability, improved energy efficiency, and increased security. However, utility providers can compromise user privacy by analyzing finegrained readings and extracting individuals’ daily activities from this invaluable time-series data. To address this privacy concern, we propose a collusion-resistance, privacy-preserving aggregation protocol for smart metering in operational services. Our protocol ensures privacy by leveraging strong privacy-enhancing techniques such as partially additive homomorphic encryptions, aggregation, data perturbation, and data minimization. The proposed scheme aggregates perturbed consumption readings by using the additive homomorphic property of the Paillier cryptosystem to provide the aggregated results for multiple operational purposes. We evaluate the proposed protocol in terms of both performance and privacy. The scheme’s computational, memory, and communication overhead were examined. The total protocol execution time with 1024-bit key size is approximately 2.21 seconds. Furthermore, we evaluated the protocol’s privacy through normalized conditional entropy (NCE) metric. Higher NCE values, closer to 1, indicate stronger privacy. We show that by increasing the noise scale, the NCE value rises. This represents perturbed value retains minimal information about the original value, thereby reducing privacy risks. Overall, evaluation results demonstrate the protocol’s efficiency while employing various privacy-preserving techniques.},

Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) plays a crucial role in smart grids by facilitating two-way communication between smart meters and the utility provider. This bidirectional communication allows intelligent meters to report fine-grained consumption data at predefined intervals, enabling accurate billing, efficient grid monitoring and management, and rapid outage detection. However, the collection of detailed consumption data can inadvertently disclose consumers’ daily activities, raising privacy concerns and potentially leading to privacy violations. To address these issues and preserve individuals’ privacy, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving smart metering protocol specifically designed to support real-time tariff billing service with dynamic policy adjustment. Our scheme employs an efficient data perturbation technique to obscure precise energy usage data from internal adversaries, including the intermediary gateways and the utility provider. Subsequently, we validate the efficiency and security of our protocol through comprehensive performance and privacy evaluations. We examined the computational, memory, and communication overhead of the proposed scheme. The execution time of our secure and privacy-aware billing system is approximately 3.94540 seconds for a complete year. Furthermore, we employed the Jensen–Shannon divergence as a privacy metric to demonstrate that our protocol can effectively safeguard users’ privacy by increasing the noise scale.},

  abstract = {LoRaWAN offers a compelling solution for delivering cost-effective network access to millions of IoT devices worldwide. However, operators face challenges in scaling their services to meet the growing demands of IoT connections. Moreover, current LoRaWANs foster competition rather than cooperation among coexisting networks, resulting in substantial capacity degradation as network density increases. To identify the root causes limiting LoRaWAN scalability and to enable harmonious coexistence among network operators, this paper conducts an in-depth investigation of operational LoRaWANs. For the first time, our study reveals that the capacity degradation in LoRaWAN is not due to traditionally believed issues (such as wireless contention or interference) but rather a newly-identified decoder contention problem. This problem cannot be resolved using conventional approaches and hinders the scaled deployment of LoRaWANs as a global IoT infrastructure. Based on our new findings, we propose design principles that guide our exploration for effective strategies to address this emerging practical problem. We develop concrete deployable solutions to mitigate contention, optimize spectrum utilization, and promote spectrum sharing among network operators. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our strategies effectively boost network capacity close to the theoretical bound, and support the coexistence of up to six networks with significant improvement in spectrum efficiency.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            LoRaWAN has become the technology of choice for increasing Internet of Things applications owing to its long range and low power consumption characteristics. However, in the uplink confirmed messaging cases, the entire retransmission could take several seconds, so it cannot be used in scenarios that require rapid confirmed messaging, such as emergency alerting and real-time controlling applications. Nevertheless, there has been limited work targeting this issue. This study presents a novel LoRaWAN gateway using edge computing to expedite the confirmed messaging process by generating the acknowledgment (ACK) locally, so that the confirmed messaging time can be significantly reduced. Additionally, the resource utilization of the network server can also be decreased due to the use of edge computing. We verified the effectiveness of our solution through extensive simulations and experiments. The confirmed messaging time between the end nodes and the gateway averaged 43 ms for a maximum of 2 retransmissions. With the adoption of edge computing on the gateway, the network server’s central processing unit (CPU), memory, and bandwidth peak utilization decrease from 53.51 to 39.46, 73.88 to 72.11\%, and 4422.68 kbps to 3271.27 kbps, respectively. In addition, the network server’s system load decreases from 2.15 to 1.69, while the gateway cost is reduced by almost                                                   \$\$\textbackslash\$\$\$                                        \$                                                                  38 compared to the benchmark products.},
